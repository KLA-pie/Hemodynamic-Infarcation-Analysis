# Hemodynamic-Infarcation-Analysis

This is a model that was created to show the differences in predicting
if an individual is susceptible to heart failure conditions using
least squares approxmiation. It is then compared to a model that
uses statistical methods based in principal component analysis,
the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid to
retrieve intial conditions, and using them for computational 
fluid dynamics to output conditions that's used to train an
AI to predict the heart condition.
